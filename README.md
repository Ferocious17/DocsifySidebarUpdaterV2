# DocsifySidebarUpdater - Version 2.0
### Program to insert a new week into Docsify navigation

This program eliminates the need of manually updating or inserting new weeks into the sidebars of a Docsify documentation.
Simply specify the path to your <code>docs/weeks</code> directory of your documentation and tell the program what week to add.
With additional files together with the weekly ones the navigation is different and needs special treatment thus this modified program was created.
